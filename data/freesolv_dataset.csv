C(CO)O,-1.4297133851571855,"The SMILES notation `C(CO)O` represents a simple organic compound. Here's a breakdown of its structure and a description:

- **Structure**: The molecule consists of three carbon atoms, one oxygen atom double-bonded to one of the carbons (forming a carbonyl group), another oxygen single-bonded to this same carbon, and the third carbon bonded to the first one as well as having two hydrogens implied but not shown in SMILES notation.
- **Functional Groups**: It contains a carboxyl (-COOH) functional group. The ""C(CO)"" part suggests an acetyl group (CH₃-CO-) or more accurately here, part of it resembles a formyl group attached to another carbon atom, but the presence of the extra oxygen and the way it's connected actually makes it closer to an acetic acid structure if we consider the full molecule in context. However, the exact structure given by `C(CO)O` specifically indicates ethanoic (acetic) acid minus a hydrogen, implying it is indeed meant to represent part of or closely related to an acetyl group but more accurately described as part of the larger form that includes the hydroxyl part.
- **Molecular Weight**: To calculate this, you would sum the atomic weights of all atoms present: 3 carbons (approximately 36 amu), 2 oxygens (approximately 32 amu). The total is about 68 amu. However, considering typical molecular representations and assuming a full acetic acid structure for easier comparison (CH₃COOH), the actual molecular weight would be closer to 60 amu because of the two implied hydrogen atoms not shown in SMILES.
- **Properties**: Acetic acid, which this molecule closely resembles or is part of, is known for its pungent smell and is widely used as a solvent. It's also a major component of vinegar.

Given these details, `C(CO)O` represents the core structure of acetic acid (ethanoic acid), minus one hydrogen atom on the hydroxyl group, which might be an incomplete representation but points towards characteristics similar to acetic acid or its derivatives in chemical contexts."

- **Ring Structure**: The sequence `c1nc(nc(n1)SC)` suggests a heterocyclic ring system. Specifically, it implies a triazine or more likely a tetrazine core due to the arrangement of nitrogen atoms (`n` and `nc` notations). This ring is substituted with a sulfide group (`SC`) on one of its nitrogen atoms.

- **Tetrazine Ring**: Given the notation `c1nc(nc(n1)`, it's clear that we have a tetrazine ring. Tetrazines are known for their ability to participate in inverse electron demand Diels-Alder (iEDDA) reactions, making them useful in bioorthogonal chemistry and drug delivery systems.

- **Sulfide Substitution**: The presence of `SC` indicates a sulfide substitution on the ring, which could be involved in further chemical modifications or act as a point for conjugation to other molecules.

- **Side Chains**: The ending sequence `NC(C)C` suggests additional aliphatic side chains attached to the nitrogen atom of an amino group.

- `1` denotes the start of a ring system, specifically indicating that the carbon atom mentioned before it is where we start counting around the ring. This number is used to close the ring later in the notation.
- `ccc(cc1)`: The repeated `c`s denote additional carbon atoms in the aromatic ring. Since there are three `c`s after the first one, this means our ring has a total of four carbon atoms so far (including the initial `c`). Then, `(cc1)` denotes two more carbon atoms in the ring, and the closing parenthesis followed by `1` indicates that we close the ring at the point initially marked with `1`, completing the description of an aromatic six-membered ring, specifically benzene.
- `F`: This represents a fluorine atom attached to one of the carbon atoms of the benzene ring.

In summary, the SMILES notation `c1ccc(cc1)F` describes Fluorobenzene (also known as phenyl fluoride), which consists of a benzene ring with one of its hydrogen atoms replaced by a fluorine atom."
CCOC(=O)C,0.2244593337752839,"The provided SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notation `CCOC(=O)C` represents a specific organic compound. Let's break it down to understand and generate a descriptive name for it:

- `CCO`: This part of the SMILES indicates a chain of two carbon atoms (`CC`) followed by an oxygen atom bonded to one of these carbons, suggesting an ether or alcohol functional group.
  
- `C(=O)`: This segment signifies a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom (carbonyl group), which is characteristic of aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, etc. However, the context provided by the rest of the molecule suggests it might be part of an ester or possibly a carboxylic acid derivative.

- `C`: The final carbon atom indicates that this carbonyl group is likely part of a carboxylate ester since it connects to another carbon, suggesting an organic ester rather than a simple carboxylic acid.

Considering the entire SMILES string `CCOC(=O)C`, the molecule appears to represent a type of ester. More specifically, this could be interpreted as butyl acetate or possibly methyl propanoate (depending on how one reads the orientation of the carbon chain and functional groups). However, given the ambiguity in interpreting SMILES without explicit stereochemistry or hydrogen atom specification, it's most accurate to describe this molecule as a carboxylic acid ester with a four-carbon backbone.

Given this analysis, let's refine our description:

**Compound Description**: This compound is an organic ester consisting of a four-carbon chain with a carbonyl group bonded to one of the terminal carbon atoms through an oxygen atom, forming an ester linkage. It likely represents butyl acetate or methyl propanoate.

1. **CC(C)C**: This part of the string indicates a chain of carbon atoms. Starting from the left, we have:
   - A carbon atom (`C`) bonded to another carbon atom.
   - The second carbon is also bonded to three other carbon atoms (one being part of the chain and two methyl groups represented by `(C)`, which means this carbon is a branching point or a tertiary carbon).
   - This chain continues with another carbon, leading to an oxygen atom.

2. **OC**: After the carbon chain described above, there's an oxygen atom bonded to it (`O`), indicating an ether linkage (an oxygen atom connecting two alkyl groups).

3. **(=O)**: Following the ether linkage is a carbonyl group (`C(=O)`). The `=` sign indicates a double bond between the carbon and the oxygen atom, which signifies a ketone or aldehyde functional group. However, given the context of the molecule (the presence of another `C` after this), it's more accurately described as part of an ester linkage.

4. **C(C)C**: The last segment describes another branched alkyl chain:
   - A carbon atom (`C`) that is bonded to two other carbons and one oxygen, forming the end of the ester linkage mentioned above.
   - This carbon also has a methyl group (`(C)`), similar to the branching observed earlier in the molecule.

**Complete Description**: The molecule represented by `CC(C)COC(=O)C(C)C` is an ester with branched alkyl groups on both sides of the carbonyl group.

CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O,-1.5961710172510188,"The given SMILES notation `CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O` represents a chemical compound. Let's break down this molecule:

- `CC(=O)O`: This part of the string indicates an ethyl ester group, where two carbon atoms are connected by a single bond (`C-C`), one of which is also double-bonded to an oxygen atom (`=O`) that is further connected to another oxygen atom (`O`). This structure suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid derivative attached to an ethyl group.

- `c1ccccc1`: This represents a benzene ring, often abbreviated as `Ph` or `C6H5`. The number `1` after `c` indicates that this is a closed loop (ring structure), and the repeating sequence of `cccc` confirms it's a six-membered ring.

- `C(=O)O`: Similar to the first part but at the end, this represents another carboxyl group (`COOH`) or more accurately in this context, a carboxylic acid group directly attached to the benzene ring. However, given its position and structure within the SMILES notation, it indicates an ester linkage.

Putting all these parts together suggests that the molecule is a diester of benzoic acid with ethyl groups on both sides of the benzene ring but in reality, the notation suggests two carboxylic acid groups connected to a phenol group through ester linkages, not directly as described initially. This confusion stems from the interpretation of `C(=O)O` at the end as an additional carboxylic group rather than part of an ester linkage with another molecule or group.

However, accurately interpreting this SMILES string without any ambiguity points towards a compound where two ethyl benzoate groups are connected through a benzene ring. Thus, considering the accuracy and common chemical structures:

The correct interpretation should be a bis(ethyl benzoate) type structure, but in reality, this specific SMILES might actually describe Ethyl 4-((ethoxycarbonyl)oxy)benzoate more accurately.

**Corrected Description:**

Given the nature of SMILES and its limitations in describing complex or ambiguous structures without additional context, it's crucial to validate interpretations against known chemical standards or databases. 

For the given molecule `CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O`, a precise description can be derived by understanding that this structure represents Ethyl 4-((ethoxycarbonyl)oxy)benzoate, where an ethyl group is attached to the benzene ring via an ester linkage at the 4th position, and another ethyl benzoate group is connected through a phenolic oxygen."

c1cc(cc(c1)O)C=O,-1.4869331961894408,"The provided SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notation `c1cc(cc(c1)O)C=O` represents a specific organic compound. To understand and describe this molecule, let's break down the SMILES notation:

- `c1`: This indicates the start of an aromatic ring that will be closed later with a number (in this case, 1). It signifies the first carbon in the ring.
- `cc(cc(c1)O)`: This describes the rest of the aromatic ring. The atoms are connected as follows: 
    - Two carbons (`cc`) are directly bonded to the initial carbon (`c1`).
    - Another carbon is bonded, which has another carbon and an oxygen atom attached (`(c1)O)`). This implies a hydroxyl group (OH) attached at this point.
- `C=O`: Outside of the ring, there's a carbon-oxygen double bond. This typically represents a carbonyl group.

From this breakdown, we can describe the molecule represented by the SMILES notation `c1cc(cc(c1)O)C=O`:

**Description**: The compound is an aromatic ketone or aldehyde with a hydroxyl (OH) substituent on one of the ring's carbon atoms. Given the presence of both an oxygen atom directly bonded to the ring and a carbonyl group (C=O), it might be more accurately described as having a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde functional group depending on its precise chemical context, but based purely on SMILES, we lean towards it being an aromatic ketone with an alcohol side chain.

However, without additional structural details or context about how the molecule behaves chemically (e.g., in reactions), this description is a best guess."
c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1,-0.0382316168727969,"A nice SMILES string!

The molecule represented by the SMILES string `c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1` is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH).

Here's a breakdown of the structure:

* The molecule consists of four fused benzene rings, which are denoted by the repeating ""cc"" and ""ccc"" patterns in the SMILES string.
* The ring system is planar, with each carbon atom bonded to three other atoms: either two hydrogen atoms or another carbon atom.

The resulting compound is likely a relatively rigid, planar molecule with a large delocalized π-electron system. This type of structure is often associated with PAHs and can exhibit interesting optical, electrical, and chemical properties.

CC(C)(C)C(=O)OC,0.3649079608544558,"The provided SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notation `CC(C)(C)C(=O)OC` represents a specific organic compound. Let's break it down:

- `CC`: This indicates two carbon atoms connected by a single bond, which is the start of an alkyl chain.
- `(C)(C)`: These are branches off the second carbon in the chain, indicating that this carbon is also bonded to two other carbon atoms, making it a tertiary carbon center. Each of these carbons could be part of larger or smaller groups, but based on the notation, they seem to represent simple methyl (CH3) groups.
- `C(=O)`: This represents a ketone functional group where a carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to another carbon atom. In this context, it suggests that one of the branches off the central carbon is actually part of an acetyl (COCH3) or similar group rather than just a methyl group.
- `OC`: This indicates an ether linkage where the carbonyl carbon from the ketone group is connected through an oxygen atom to another carbon, but in this simplified notation, it might be slightly misleading. Typically, the `C(=O)OC` sequence would suggest an ester linkage rather than a simple ether, given the context of how these functional groups are usually represented.

Given this breakdown, the SMILES `CC(C)(C)C(=O)OC` likely represents tert-butyl acetate or a similar compound with an ester functionality. Tert-butyl acetate is used as a solvent and in various chemical syntheses due to its properties such as being less toxic than some other organic solvents.

* `CC`: Two carbon atoms are bonded together in a chain.
* `[S+2]`: A sulfur atom is present with a +2 charge (i.e., Sulfur(II)), indicating that it has two less electrons than the neutral sulfur atom.

Cc1cccc(c1O)C,-0.378949582564862,"The given SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notation ""Cc1cccc(c1O)C"" represents a specific organic compound. To break it down:

- `C`: Represents a carbon atom.
- `c1cccc(c1O)`: This describes an aromatic ring where one of the carbon atoms is labeled as '1' (c1), and the sequence continues with four other carbon atoms in the ring, finally closing back to the first carbon ('c1') which also has an oxygen atom attached (`O`).
- The parentheses indicate a side chain or branch from the main structure.
- The final `C`: Indicates that there is another carbon atom (which could be part of an alkyl group) attached directly to the aromatic ring.

Given this breakdown, we can interpret the molecule as follows:

The compound consists of a benzene ring with two different substituents: one is an alcohol group (-OH), indicated by the `O` atom attached directly to one of the carbon atoms in the ring; the other is an ethyl group (-C2H5 or more simply `-CH2CH3`), represented by the initial `C` followed by the rest of the structure. Therefore, this molecule can be described as a phenol derivative where the benzene ring is substituted with both a hydroxyl group and an ethyl group.

The IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) name for such a compound might vary based on precise structural arrangements not fully specified by SMILES alone. However, based on common nomenclature practices, if we assume the ethyl group is attached to one of the carbon atoms adjacent to the hydroxyl-substituted carbon in the benzene ring, this molecule could be referred to as 4-ethylphenol or more specifically if considering all possible arrangements (o-, m-, p-) with respect to the -OH and -C2H5 substituents.

For example, one specific arrangement would result in a compound named ""4-Ethylphenol"" which has a structure fitting this SMILES notation."
